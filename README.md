This is a Machine Learning model for the prediction of the different Chronic Diseases.

•	Developed using StreamLit API, integrating machine learning for Cardiovascular, Diabetes and Parkinson Disease prediction.

•	Utilized datasets such as the Pima Indians Diabetes Database and the UCI Heart Disease dataset for training and testing.

•	Identified optimal algorithms including Logistic Regression for Heart Disease (85% accuracy) and SVM for Parkinson's Disease (87% accuracy).

•	Deployed the model using StreamLit in Python, enabling users to input values and obtain disease predictions via a user-friendly web interface.
